Overview:
This project is composed of four portions:
1. co-shceduling algorithm
2. schedule result execution
3. auto test
4. data process

data process part:
-->MergeOutput.py
[INPUT]
schedule result format:
note: txt file name -> AUTOTEST_COMBINATION(in CO_SCHEDULING_HOME/config/path.py)
note: the schedule result file insist of a head line with results, the head line contains a series of algorithm name separated in ' '.
note: some attribute order must check for real json file
schedule result is list format:
schedule_result = [scheduleObj, scheduleObj, ...]
scheduleObj = {algorithmName: taskSets, ...}
taskSets = {taskNameSeq: taskSet, ...}
taskSet = {taskName: taskAttr, ...}
taskAttr = {instructions: instruction_num, cycle: cycle_num, miss: miss_num, access: access_num}

corun result format:
note: txt file name -> AUTOTEST_CORUNOUT(in CO_SCHEDULING_HOME/config/path.py)
note: the result file separator is '*'ï¼Œ so the first letter of taskName cannot be '*'
the taskNameSeq must consist of sorted taskNames
corun result is list format:
corun_result = {taskNameSeq: taskSet, ...}
taskSet = {taskName: taskAttr, ...}
taskAttr = {instructions: instruction_num, cycle: cycle_num, miss: miss_num, access: access_num}
