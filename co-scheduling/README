schedule result format:
# txt file name: AUTOTEST_COMBINATION
# note: the schedule result file insist of a head line with results, the head line contains a series of algorithm name separated in ' '.
# note: some attribute order must check for real json file
# schedule result is list format:
# schedule_result = [scheduleObj, scheduleObj, ...]
# scheduleObj = {algorithmName: taskSets, ...}
# taskSets = {taskNameSeq: taskSet, ...}
# taskSet = {taskName: taskAttr, ...}
# taskAttr = {cycle: cycle_num, instructions: instruction_num, miss: miss_num, access: access_num}

corun result format:
# txt file name: AUTOTEST_CORUNOUT
# note: the result file separator is '*'ï¼Œ so the first letter of taskName cannot be '*'
# the taskNameSeq must consist of sorted taskNames
# corun result is list format:
# corun_result = {taskNameSeq: taskSet, ...}
# taskSet = {taskName: taskAttr, ...}
# taskAttr = {cycle: cycle_num, instructions: instruction_num, miss: miss_num, access: access_num}
